          <h3>Python Escape Room</h3>
          <p>An escape room built entirely with Python. A mysterious virus outbreak completely overruns a laboratory. Being the last remaining scientist in the laboratory, you must escape with the vaccine before it is lost forever. The user must complete several tasks varying in difficulty and type to escape the facility with the vaccine. The user is assisted by S.A.M, a Support Automated Machine the entire way. A single failure and the virus catches up to you, leading to ultimate failure. Do you have what it takes to escape the facility?<br><br><a href="./Projects.html#project_1_id">Read More</a></p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>The only way to gain experience in a field is by participating in activities related to said field. Whether it be studying, applying, or criticizing, you can always learn something from these activities. Throughout this year, I have gained experience in the field of computer science through projects. These projects have allowed me to apply the knowledge I already have the field and also look into the mind of a programmer. Scroll through or use the two containers to learn more about some of the projects I have created this year.</p>

          <h3>Creative Expression</h3>
          <p>Expressing yourself is important. However, expressing yourself is not always the easiest task, especially when it comes to politics. Why not use an application instead? This application has the user assume the role of a presidential candidate. From the first debate to swaying the public with small actions, every decision matters. At the end of the day, only one can be left victorious. Are you worthy enough of becoming the next president of the United States?

          The objective of this project was to create a text-based escape room that a user could play. The project had to be COVID-related in at least one aspect. My partner and I decided to create a multi-level adventure, with each level consisting of a different type of challenge. These challenges included trivia, decoding ciphers, and a series of riddles. Each challenge consisted of three puzzles the user had to successfully complete before moving on to the next challenge. To meet the COVID-related criteria, we opted to make most of the trivia questions COVID-related, creating ciphers that decoded to words related to COVID, and implementing a mini story and antagonist in S.A.M. Considering this project was meant to be completed relatively quickly, my partner and I worked together on each challenge to meet the sharp deadlines. For example, if I did the welcome paragraph and the first puzzle of challenge one, my partner would do the last two puzzles of challenge one to complete it. The process was very tedious, and as a result, multiple bugs occurred. We were able to successfully bypass each issue by working together to develop a solution that would not only fix the targeted issue, but would also improve the quality of the game. This project was the first time in the class we used nearly our entire knowledge of Python. My partner and I’s success came primarily from our communication, as we were able to successfully communicate new ideas, questions, and issues. The escape room can be played on the right. </p>

          The objective of this project was to create a functioning app that reflected a current major event. It didn't have to be worldwide, but it did have to have lots of attention towards it. The project did not have many boundaries except for this. My partner, who is the same partner I worked with on the Python project, and I decided to make an application related to the presidential election, as the presidental election was trending during this time. In this app, the user assumed the role of a presidential candidate who must make certain decisions to leverage the public in their favor. The game was split across six different scenes, with each scene revolving around a different event in the election process. Seeing as this project would take a significant amount of work over about a month long period, we chose to split up the code by designating each alternating scene to one person. For example, person one would do scenes 1, 3, and 5, while person two would do scenes 2, 4, and 6. For the first part of the project, we worked separately as we were simply developing each scene. We then began to combine them and worked on final changes together before submitting the final product. In all parts of the project, there were several issues and problems that arose. By working together on these issues, we were able to successfully solve every problem. My partner and I’s success came primarily from our communication, as we were able to successfully communicate new ideas, questions, and issues, even though part of the project was done separately. Another key to our success was responsibility. We always met our deadlines, completeed work outside of class, and went to office hours consistently to receive feedback.</p>
