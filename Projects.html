        <p><strong><u> Python Escape Room: </u></strong><br><br>
          <i>Computer Science Essentials	<br><br>
          March 24, 2021 - April 14, 2021	</i><br><br>
		
          The objective of this project was to create a text-based escape room that a user could play. The project had to be COVID-related in at least one aspect. My partner and I decided to create a multi-level adventure, with each level consisting of a different type of challenge. These challenges included trivia, decoding ciphers, and a series of riddles. Each challenge consisted of three puzzles the user had to successfully complete before moving on to the next challenge. To meet the COVID-related criteria, we opted to make most of the trivia questions COVID-related, creating ciphers that decoded to words related to COVID, and implementing a mini story and antagonist in S.A.M. Considering this project was meant to be completed relatively quickly, my partner and I worked together on each challenge to meet the sharp deadlines. For example, if I did the welcome paragraph and the first puzzle of challenge one, my partner would do the last two puzzles of challenge one to complete it. The process was very tedious, and as a result, multiple bugs occurred. We were able to successfully bypass each issue by working together to develop a solution that would not only fix the targeted issue, but would also improve the quality of the game. This project was the first time in the class we used nearly our entire knowledge of Python. My partner and I’s success came primarily from our communication, as we were able to successfully communicate new ideas, questions, and issues.</p>

          The objective of this project was to create a functioning app that reflected a current major event. The project did not have many boundaries except for this. My partner, who is the same partner I worked with on the Python project, and I decided to make an application related to the presidential election. In this app, the user assumed the role of a presidential candidate who must make certain decisions to leverage the public in their favor. The game was split across six different scenes, with each scene revolving around a different event in the election process. Seeing as this project would take a significant amount of work over about a month long period, we chose to split up the code by designating each alternating scene to one person. For example, person one would do scenes 1, 3, and 5, while person two would do scenes 2, 4, and 6. For the first part of the project, we worked separately as we were simply developing each scene. We then began to combine them and worked on final changes together before submitting the final product. In all parts of the project, there were several issues and problems that arose. By working together on these issues, we were able to successfully solve every problem. My partner and I’s success came primarily from our communication, as we were able to successfully communicate new ideas, questions, and issues, even though part of the project was done separately. </p>
