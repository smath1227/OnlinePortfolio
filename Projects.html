          <h3>Hangman</h3>
          <p> Hangman is a classic game that people have played for decades, providing entertainment in even the most boring places and situations. However, a second person is typically required for the game, and you won't always have another person to play with. The optimal solution is to play with a computer that has no bias and cannot change the word mid-game just to see you lose. Our Python-based Hangman game sets the player in their choice of difficulty, ranging from easy to impossible. Do you have what it takes to beat the computer?

          The Compound Machines Project, more formally known as P1.1.6 Compound Machines, was a project involving the application of various simple machines to accomplish a basic task. The compound machine had to be constructed using four unique simple machines, each of which was required to contribute the machine’s overall purpose in a significant manner. The compound machine would be built out of primarily VEX parts, however, other materials were also significant, including tape, string, and function-specific items. Given the requirements and boundaries, my group and I formed several ideas, ranging from fruit cutters to catapults, until we finally settled on one: a compound machine that stamps paper. According to our original design, the machine would be composed of a gear train, pulley, chain & sprocket, and a wheel. After reviewing the design further, however, it was determined that completing the machine in the allotted time would be extremely difficult, especially considering the amount of fine-tuning required for the design. To improve the original design, the chain & sprocket system was replaced with a first-class lever, which was significantly easier to create and was less dependent on luck. Under the new design, the input force would be applied to a wheel spinning an axle, with the axle connecting to the bottom of the pulley system. The pulley system is subsequently activated from the movement of the wheel and begins to pull a string. The string is tied to the pulley system on one end and the first-class lever on the other end. As the string is pulled, the first-class lever is tilted in such a way that raises the side attached directly to the pulley. On the other side of the lever, a string attaches the lever to a gear train. As the lever tilts, the gear train is pulled, ultimately placing the stamp onto the paper at the end of the gear train. Considering the project was relatively long in comparison to other projects and the sheer amount of unique functions that needed to be designed, tested, and prototyped, dividing the work was an absolute necessity to even complete the project at all. Several sections of the build were completed individually, while other parts were completed in pairs. Despite this, our group maintained stellar communication. This included asking questions frequently to ensure an understanding of how to build each mechanism, discussing any issues, and coming up with new ideas as the project continued. As always, communication and teamwork were principal to completing the project in a timely and efficient manner. </p>

          The name of the project says it all. The primary goal of the hangman project was to create a functioning version of the classic game “Hangman” using Python. There were very few boundaries as to how this could be accomplished, with the only real restriction being the game’s functionality. As a result, my partner and I decided to add a visual display using turtle graphics to truly illustrate the Hangman experience. To accomplish this, my partner, Youchaun, and I chose to divide the program’s functionality across three functions based on what aspect of the game is affected. These functions were a function that created the visual display, a function that created the dashes and updated them upon every guess, and a function that decremented the guess count and acted accordingly based on the guess count. Considering this project was to be completed within roughly a week, our team decided to divide the work evenly to maximize production and efficiency. Although we did several tasks independently, whenever an issue occurred, we immediately discussed it and worked the issue out swiftly. As evident, communication was a key part of our team’s success, as we were successful in communicating new ideas and questions, while also delegating tasks effectively. Furthermore, responsibility played a large part in our team's success, as we consistently met deadlines and took care of our individual parts to earn the highest possible score on the project. The fundamental ideas that led to my partner and I's success are applicable to real world, in both the engineering world and everyday life. <br><br><br><br></br></br></br></br></p>

            The Algorithms & Art project, more formally known as the PLTW 1.1.9 Project, was a dynamic project that combined Python algorithms and artistic talent. The primary objective of the project was to develop a program that designed a PSA regarding mental health, with the primary audience being students. Compared to projects in the past, this project contained several restrictions and specific criteria that had to be met. For example, the project had to include some form of animation, whether it be text-related or image-related. The project also had to follow all of the AP CSP Create Task rubric rows. To fulfill all of the requirements, my partner and I developed an interactive poster that reminded students to take care of their “personal garden”, a metaphor for a person’s mental and physical well-being. The program itself contained several different functions, each responsible for creating a unique part of the landscape portrayed in the poster. For example, the background, including the sky, flowers, and ground, were all contained within a single function. This function would then be stored within a list and called when the list was iterated through. Considering the project was relatively long in comparison to other projects and the sheer amount of unique functions within the code, dividing the work was an absolute necessity to even complete the project at all. Several sections of the code were completed individually, while other parts were completed in class together. Despite this, my partner and I maintained stellar communication. This included asking questions frequently to understand the other’s code, discussing any issues, and coming up with new ideas as the project continued. As always, communication and teamwork were principal to completing the project in a timely and efficient manner. <br><br><br><br></br></br></br></br></p>

          The objective of this project was to create a text-based escape room that a user could play. The project had to be COVID-related in at least one aspect. My partner and I decided to create a multi-level adventure, with each level consisting of a different type of challenge. These challenges included trivia, decoding ciphers, and a series of riddles. Each challenge consisted of three puzzles the user had to successfully complete before moving on to the next challenge. To meet the COVID-related criteria, we opted to make most of the trivia questions COVID-related, creating ciphers that decoded to words related to COVID, and implementing a mini story and antagonist in S.A.M. Considering this project was meant to be completed relatively quickly, my partner and I worked together on each challenge to meet the sharp deadlines. For example, if I did the welcome paragraph and the first puzzle of challenge one, my partner would do the last two puzzles of challenge one to complete it. The process was very tedious, and as a result, multiple bugs occurred. We were able to successfully bypass each issue by working together to develop a solution that would not only fix the targeted issue, but would also improve the quality of the game. This project was the first time in the class we used nearly our entire knowledge of Python. My partner and I’s success came primarily from our communication, as we were able to successfully communicate new ideas, questions, and issues. The escape room can be played on the right. </p>

          The objective of this project was to create a functioning app that reflected a current major event. It didn't have to be worldwide, but it did have to have lots of attention towards it. The project did not have many boundaries except for this. My partner, who is the same partner I worked with on the Python project, and I decided to make an application related to the presidential election, as the presidental election was trending during this time. In this app, the user assumed the role of a presidential candidate who must make certain decisions to leverage the public in their favor. The game was split across six different scenes, with each scene revolving around a different event in the election process. Seeing as this project would take a significant amount of work over about a month long period, we chose to split up the code by designating each alternating scene to one person. For example, person one would do scenes 1, 3, and 5, while person two would do scenes 2, 4, and 6. For the first part of the project, we worked separately as we were simply developing each scene. We then began to combine them and worked on final changes together before submitting the final product. <br></br>In all parts of the project, there were several issues and problems that arose. By working together on these issues, we were able to successfully solve every problem. My partner and I’s success came primarily from our communication, as we were able to successfully communicate new ideas, questions, and issues, even though part of the project was done separately. Another key to our success was responsibility. We always met our deadlines, completed work outside of class, and went to office hours consistently to receive feedback.</p>
