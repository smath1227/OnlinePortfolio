Your about me page MUST be your index.html that file is 100% needed in order to successfully push to GitHub (aka DO NOT CHANGE THAT FILE NAME). I have also set-up demo pages for other content that is required as well as a CSS and JavaScript Page. 

Those two must stay as the generic name as well to integrate with github properly.

Please also make sure all Images are in the Images folder and that you link to your content properly. You should always load any content that is possible onto a server and use the source items from that server over something else (aka upload images to this repl and then link to them using the command line linking you learned about (ex. ./Images/my.jpg))

Lastly, once you have finished creating all content (or once you have finished your about me page) we will click on the version control button and link this repl to github. Once we are on github we will modify the settings to be a git page and we are all set. You will then continue to make edits on Replit and push updates to github as needed. You now have a fully hosted and public site on github
