          <h3>Python Escape Room</h3>
          <p>An escape room built entirely with Python. A mysterious virus outbreak completely overruns a laboratory. Being the last remaining scientist in the laboratory, you must escape with the vaccine before it is lost forever. The user must complete several tasks varying in difficulty and type to escape the facility with the vaccine. The user is assisted by S.A.M, a Support Automated Machine the entire way. A single failure and the virus catches up to you, leading to ultimate failure. Do you have what it takes to escape the facility?<br><br><a href="./Projects.html#project_1_id">Read More</a></p>

          <p>Expressing yourself is important. However, expressing yourself is not always the easiest task, especially when it comes to politics. Why not use an application instead? This application has the user assume the role of a presidential candidate. From the first debate to swaying the public with small actions, every decision matters. At the end of the day, only one can be left victorious. Are you worthy enough of becoming the next president of the United States?<br><br><a href="./Projects.html#project_2_id">Read More</a></p>

          <p>Every skilled human being has done something they are proud of. These skills and accomplishments can be used to land a job. Work experience gained from these jobs can be used to show off one's many talents and skills. We even use them to land even more jobs by putting them in resumes. Resumes combine work experience, skills, education, and a clearly defined objective to showcase the strengths of a potential employee.

      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h6 class="about_me_description">
        There are few professions in the world that can truly say there are no limits. Some may even say these professions are “out of this world”. For me, this profession is the world of computer science engineering. Currently, I am exploring the multiple classes and clubs at Dublin High School that may relate to this field. There are few professions that truly test one’s mathematical, science, and engineering abilities all at the same time, however, computer science engineering is one of them. <br><br>
        <i><strong>Where did my interest begin?</strong></i> <br><br>
        My interest in computer science started when I was around nine years old. My brother was taking AP Computer Science Principles in high school. One day, he decided to show me a project he was working on. It was a program that would display a number based on what number the user puts up in the webcam. For example, if the user put two fingers up, the program would display a "2". Thinking about it now, it wasn't the hardest program ever to create. It most likely took a few hours at most. However, I had no way of knowing this as a child. <br><br>
        <i><strong>What does it take to be an engineer?</strong></i> <br><br>
        In the realm of engineering, cooperation, critical thinking, and mathematical ability are some of the most important characteristics an engineer must have. Throughout high school so far, I have been able to accomplish multiple things that have been demonstrative of my passion for engineering. I am currently in Gael Force Robotics, have attended multiple guest speaker events under the topic of engineering, and have even structured my high school electives around engineering. Engineering is dependent on math and science as well, which is why I have participated in multiple science competitions and even a math competition. I am currently two years ahead of my class in math, and have maintained a near-perfect score in three years of science. In the future, I plan on joining more engineering clubs, taking more engineering classes, and joining the competitive team for Gael Force Robotics. To gain the communication and collaboration skills an engineer requires, I also plan on joining Dublin Key Club and possibly Teens for Tutors.<br><br>
        My experiences have taught me important life lessons.  I have learned how important it is to cooperate and become a leader. I have also learned the importance of perseverance and striving for a better self. By the end of it, I hope to accomplish my goals and achieve everything I have set. </p>
